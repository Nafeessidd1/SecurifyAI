# Smart Surveillance System with YOLO v5

This repository contains the code for a Smart Surveillance System developed using YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 7. The system is designed to monitor surveillance camera feeds in real-time and perform various tasks such as detecting unauthorized persons entering restricted areas, identifying abandoned objects, and recognizing specific actions such as fighting or vandalism and an alarm sound is played and photos of the detected image is saved.
This tool can be used for security purposes


## Features

- **Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLO v5 for real-time object detection in surveillance camera feeds.
- **Unauthorized Person Detection**: Detects and alerts when unauthorized persons enter restricted areas.
- **Abandoned Object Detection**: Identifies and notifies about abandoned objects in the surveillance area.
- **Action Recognition**: Recognizes specific actions such as fighting or vandalism and triggers appropriate responses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pygame
- YOLO v5 (pre-trained weights and configuration files)

## Installation
